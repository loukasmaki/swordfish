# The Swordfish HEMA tournament plattform

The goal is to create an all in one tournament hosting plattform tailored for the specific needs of Swordfish and then make it into a template for other tournaments.

## Acknowledgements and praise

This project owes alot of it's structure and functionality to Miguel Grinbergs flaskbook and mega flask tutorial. 
Stripe integration i adapted from the guide by pretty printed and Stripes own offical documentation. 

Countless pages on stackoverflow.

Any mistakes in the code are probably my own.
